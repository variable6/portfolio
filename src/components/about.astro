      Hi, I&apos;m <strong>Pranay kumar</strong> — a Software Engineer passionate about building scalable web and mobile applications
      that make a difference.
    </p><p>
      With over 3 years of professional experience, I&apos;ve led engineering teams, architected microservice-based systems,
      and delivered robust solutions using technologies like <b>React</b>, <b>Node.js</b>, <b>GraphQL</b>, <b>Flutter</b>, and
      <b>gRPC</b>. From building real-time social platforms to mentoring junior engineers, I thrive at the intersection of
      clean code, performance, and collaboration.
    </p><p>
      I enjoy solving complex technical challenges and am constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to stay ahead in the
      ever-evolving tech world. Whether it's designing APIs, implementing responsive UI, or scaling backend services — I aim
      to build products that are both efficient and user-focused.
    </p><p>
      When I&apos;m not coding, I love sharing knowledge, contributing to side projects, and exploring the latest in developer
      tooling and architecture.
    </p><p>Let&apos;s build something amazing together!</p>
